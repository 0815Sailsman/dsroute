# Dsroute
Angular app to plan a Dark Souls Remastered Playthrough. The goal of this project is, to make brainstorming a route for stuff like a no-death-run easier. Ideally, one could integrate this with some kind of autosplitter, that automatically tracks your progress in game, but that will be another project.

Recently moved planning into issues if this seems empty ^^
