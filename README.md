# Dsroute
Angular app to plan a Dark Souls Remastered Playthrough. The goal of this project is, to make brainstorming a route for stuff like a no-death-run easier. Ideally, one could integrate this with some kind of autosplitter, that automatically tracks your progress in game, but that will be another project.
